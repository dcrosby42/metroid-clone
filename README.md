# Game dev sandbox using Node, Coffeescript and Pixi

For HTML5 game dev, I wanted a dev environment where I can design reasonably clean code using Coffeescript and node-style includes, modules and depedency management.

Assuming NodeJS and NPM are running on your system:

    $ npm install
    $ gulp

Your browser will launch, and any change to markup, code and styles are automatically sent to the browser.

* Bring in deps like pixi, jquery, emberjs, knockout etc. all via npm
* CoffeeScript and Sass/Scss
* Browserify
* Watchify
* BrowserSync


Dan Tello's blog post about getting Gulp + all-the-things up and running:

* https://github.com/greypants/gulp-starter

...and add this PixiJS tutorial: 

* "Building a Parallax Scroller in Pixi"
* Part 1: http://www.yeahbutisitflash.com/?p=5226
* Part 2: http://www.yeahbutisitflash.com/?p=5666
* Part 3: http://www.yeahbutisitflash.com/?p=6496
* Part 4: http://www.yeahbutisitflash.com/?p=7046

(Note that the tut is circa Pixi 1.3 and I'm using 2.2 but whatevs)
